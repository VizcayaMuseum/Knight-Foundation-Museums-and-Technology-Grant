# Knight-Foundation-Museums-and-Technology-Grant
Through a John S. and James L. Knight Foundation Museums and Technology Grant Vizcaya Museum and Gardens will attract and engage its visitors in new and innovative ways by bridging established preservation technologies with interpretive digital technologies. Using 3-D interactive technology Vizcaya will transport visitors to spaces and even time periods to allow them to freely explore aspects of this National Historic Landmark. This innovative approach to preservation, audience engagement, accessibility and interpretation can serve as a model for other museums and heritage sites. Utilizing data collected by the University of Florida via laser scanning and by the University of Miami via photogrammetry, Vizcaya will work with Daruma Tech to finalize 3D models of the Barge and Pool ceiling mural and create interactive interfaces that will enable the user to explore these collection elements as well as learn more about them, including their provenance, conservation issues, and how they have evolved over time.  These interfaces will be made available to museum visitors via a kiosk installed in the Main House, through a virtual/augmented reality platform that is compatible with Google Cardboard or similar tool and a virtual online interactive web module for offsite visitor access.  In addition, Vizcaya will print 3D scaled replicas of the Barge and its sculptures as well as sections of the Pool ceiling mural and specific objects to establish a handling collection for general visitors and student groups.
